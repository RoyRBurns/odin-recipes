       <h3>Ingredients</h3>
       <ul>
           <li>Italian Sausage</li>
           <li>Onion</li>
           <li>Marinara Sauce</li>
           <li>Minced Garlic</li>
           <li>Italian Seasoning</li>
           <li>Ravioli</li>
           <li>Mazzarella and Parmesan Cheese</li>
           <li>Fresh Basil</li>
       </ul>

       <h3>Steps</h3>

       <ol>
           <li><strong>Make the sauce:</strong> In a large skillet, cook the Italian sausage and onion until the sausage is browned. 
                       Mix in tomato sauce, garlic, and Italian seasoning, then simmer while you cook the ravioli.</li>
           
           <li><strong>Cook the ravioli:</strong> Bring a pot of salted water to a boil, add in the ravioli, then cook until al dente. 
                       Remember to reserve some of the pasta water before you drain it! We add it to the sauce to keep it, well, saucy! 
                       Otherwise this baked pasta can become quite thick in the oven.</li>
          
           <li><strong>Assemble and bake:</strong> Add the cooked ravioli and sauce to a lightly greased 9×13″ baking dish and toss lightly to coat. 
                       Top with mozzarella and parmesan, then bake for 15 minutes.</li>
            
           <li><strong>Serve:</strong> Top with fresh basil, then serve and enjoy!</li>
       </ol>
